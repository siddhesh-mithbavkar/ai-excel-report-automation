**Dataset Overview**

Our dataset contains 1000 rows of information across 14 categories, including employee details, job roles, and compensation. The data is relatively clean, with no duplicate rows and only 915 missing values, primarily in the "Exit Date" column.

**Annual Salary Metric**

The average annual salary is $113,217, with a total compensation of $113,217,365 across all employees. Salaries range from a minimum of $40,063 to a maximum of $258,498. This suggests a relatively wide spread in compensation, indicating varying levels of experience, skill, and job responsibility.

**Departmental Insights**

When examining the dataset by department, we see that 'IT' has the largest number of employees (241), followed closely by 'Engineering' (158) and 'Sales' (140). These departments tend to have higher average salaries, with 'IT' and 'Engineering' employees earning significantly more than those in other departments.

**Data Quality**

While there are some missing values, particularly in the "Exit Date" column, the overall data quality is good. With no duplicate rows and only a small percentage of missing values, we can rely on the data for analysis.
